# Script for elevator

## The Task:

Create a script for an elevator. Use the principles of OOP.

## Description:

Classes and interfaces are in the `elevatorscript` directory.

Script consists of five objects of different classes that interact with each other.

**OOP principles used:**

*Encapsulation* - to hide the implementation details and only expose the methods. Access to the class variables is via methods such as get and set.

*Inheritance* - the child class uses the methods defined in the parent class.

*Polymorphism* - when the same function can be used for different purposes in different objects.
